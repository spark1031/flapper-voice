Play [Flapper (Winter Edition)](https://spark1031.github.io/flapper-voice/)

Flapper (Winter Edition) is a version of Flappy Bird, with a twist. The player's job is to help Flapper navigate the winter terrain and migrate South to rejoin her flock. The player has the option of using keyboard controls or voice commands to direct Flapper.

This project was built over the course of 5 days, and plans to improve voice commands are in the works.
